# Security Policies and Procedures

## Reporting a Bug

We take all security bugs in systeminformation seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of systeminformation. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

To ensure the timely response to your report, please ensure that the entirety
of the report is contained, when reporting a security issue.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Pre-release Versions

Alpha and Beta releases are unstable and **not suitable for production use**.
Vulnerabilities found in pre-releases should be reported according to the [Reporting a Bug](#reporting-a-bug) section.
Due to the unstable nature of the branch it is not guaranteed that any fixes will be released in the next pre-release.

## Disclosure Policy

When we will receiving a security bug report, we will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible to npm.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
